# Biography
Hi! I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN) in Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof. Zhen Wang](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1369.htm).

I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Harbin Engineering University in June 2022. Previously, I worked closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) as an intern at Shanghai AI Lab for seven months. And I also interned at Tencent AI Lab for three months, mainly focusing on designing anthropomorphic game AI bots via Reinforcement Learning.

# Research Interests
My goal is to develop an intelligent decision-making system that possesses optimality, generalizability and robustness. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:
* Generalization & Adaptation (Cross-dynamics/Rewards; Robustness; Meta RL; Sim-to-Real transfer)
* Learning with Prior Knowledge (Offline RL; Offline-to-Online RL; Learning from Demonstration)
* Learning with Generative models (Diffuser; Decison-Diffuser; SynthER)
* Human-in-the-Loop (Task Specification with Preferences/Symbolic Representation/Language Instruction)
