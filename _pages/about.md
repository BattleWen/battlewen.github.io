# Biography
Hi &#129303;! I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN) in Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) and [Prof. Zhen Wang](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1369.htm).

I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Harbin Engineering University in June 2022. Previously, I worked closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) as an intern at Shanghai AI Lab for seven months. And I also interned at Tencent AI Lab for three months, mainly focusing on designing anthropomorphic game AI bots via Reinforcement Learning.

# Research Interests
My goal is to develop an intelligent decision-making system that possesses optimality, generalizability, interpretability and robustness. To achieve this, I primarily focus on &#129300;:
* Generalist Reinforcement Learning and its applications in the real world.
* Generative models (e.g., flow and diffusion models) and their applications.
* Large foundation models for reasoning and decision-making.

 &#128522; I am open to any collaboration.
